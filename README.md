# Great-GitHub-To-Discord-Webhooks
Discord offers a good default WebHook, but sadly it does not support all
the events I deemed interesting and I wanted to filter reported events by repository too.

This is why I've created *Great-GitHub-To-Discord-Webhooks* (great name, I know).

## Features
`// TODO: Write a great README.md`

The project is still Work In Progress â€“ It works for my use-case right now but I'll probably extend it for my use-case
too

For now, there's no UI to configure the WebHooks, so you'd have to host the project yourself... But you don't even know
the features yet, sooo... lucky me!
